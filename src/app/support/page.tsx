                        Financial resources are the lifeblood of a non-profit. Wheels of Mercy is an entirely volunteer organization.
                        Your financial support will pay for things like fuel for volunteers who pick up wheelchairs, spare parts, and
                        shipping costs. So give if you can. LINK TO DONATION PAGE/DONATE BUTTON

                        If you possess a particular skill or knowledge base that can further our mission, we want to hear from you. If
                        you are mechanically inclined and can repair wheelchairs we can use you, no experience necessary. If you
                        drive a pickup or van and have time to transport chairs, we need you.
