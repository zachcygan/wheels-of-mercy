                                At 16 I sustained a spinal cord injury which rendered me a quadriplegic. I spent the next
                                decade trying to find my feet and adjust to life with a disability. As I adjusted, a desire
                                grew within me to give meaning to my new life.

                                The journey to founding Wheels of Mercy started when I got a job at a wheelchair
                                dealership. During my time there I learned how to evaluate and fit someone for a
                                wheelchair. As managed care came to Medicaid, I recognized that the way wheelchairs
                                were acquired was going to change.

                                In response to this emerging market, I quit my job and founded Adaptive Technologies
                                Group (ATG). ATG contracted with CalOPTIMA and 16 Medi-Cal Health Plans in
                                Orange County to provide wheelchair evaluations and fittings. It was while conducting
                                wheelchair evaluations in consumerâ€™s homes that I became aware of how many fully
                                functional, highly specialized wheelchairs were doing nothing more than collecting dust.
                                Nearly every consumer we met with was storing at least two, sometimes three of their
                                previous wheelchairs. My work was interrupted by a massive brain hemorrhage which
                                put me in a coma.
